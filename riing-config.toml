# Riing Trio Controller Configuration - Effects Edition
# This file defines persistent settings for your fans and LEDs
# Used with: riing-trio-controller daemon

# Daemon settings
[daemon]
# How often to reapply static colors (in seconds)
# LEDs reset after ~7 seconds, so keep this at 5-6
# Animated effects run at 30 FPS automatically
interval_seconds = 5

# Apply speed settings once at startup only (default: true)
# Fan speeds PERSIST after being set (unlike LEDs which reset)
speed_once_at_startup = true

# ===== EXAMPLES =====

# Example 1: Static color with brightness
[ports.1]
speed = 50
effect = "static"
color = "cyan"
brightness = 0.8  # 80% brightness

# Example 2: Spectrum/Rainbow effect
[ports.2]
speed = 75
effect = "spectrum"
effect_speed = "normal"  # extreme, fast, normal, slow

# Example 3: Pulse/Breathing effect
#[ports.3]
#speed = 60
#effect = "pulse"
#color = "blue"
#effect_speed = "slow"

# Example 4: Wave effect
#[ports.3]
#effect = "wave"
#color = "green"
#effect_speed = "fast"

# Example 5: Flow effect with custom colors
#[ports.4]
#effect = "flow"
#flow_colors = "red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple"
#effect_speed = "normal"

# Example 6: Ripple effect
#[ports.5]
#effect = "ripple"
#color = "magenta"
#effect_speed = "fast"
