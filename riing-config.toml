# Riing Trio Controller Configuration - Effects Edition
# This file defines persistent settings for your fans and LEDs
# Used with: riing-trio-controller daemon

# Daemon settings
[daemon]
# How often to reapply static colors (in seconds)
# LEDs reset after ~7 seconds, so keep this at 5-6
# Animated effects run at 30 FPS automatically
interval_seconds = 5

# Apply speed settings once at startup only (default: true)
# Fan speeds PERSIST after being set (unlike LEDs which reset)

# ===== AVAILABLE OPTIONS =====
#
# Effect Types:
# - "static"         - Solid color (default if only color specified)
# - "spectrum"       - Rainbow color cycle (all LEDs same color)
# - "wave"           - Wave pattern traveling around ring
# - "pulse"          - Breathing/pulsing effect
# - "blink"          - On/off blinking
# - "flow"           - Colors flowing around ring
# - "ripple"         - Expanding waves from center
# - "temp_reactive"  - Change effects based on temperature (see examples above)
#
# Effect Speeds:
# - "extreme"   - Very fast (1 second cycle)
# - "fast"      - Fast (2 second cycle)
# - "normal"    - Normal speed (4 second cycle)
# - "slow"      - Slow (8 second cycle)
#
# Available Colors:
# - "off" / "black"  - Off
# - "white"          - White
# - "red"            - Red
# - "green"          - Green
# - "blue"           - Blue
# - "cyan"           - Cyan
# - "magenta"        - Magenta
# - "yellow"         - Yellow
# - "orange"         - Orange
# - "purple"         - Purple
# - "pink"           - Pink
# - "lime"           - Lime green
# - "sky"            - Sky blue
#
# Brightness:
# - 0.0 to 1.0 (0% to 100%)
# - Default: 1.0 (100%)
#
# Fan Speed:
# - 0 to 100 (percentage)
# - Minimum RPM is ~500 (below 30% does nothing)
#
# LED Count:
# - Default: 30 (Riing Trio fans)
# - Only change if using different fans
#
# Advanced:
# - reapply_speed = true   - Force speed reapplication (rarely needed)
#
# Temperature-Reactive Options:
# - sensor: Temperature sensor to monitor
#   - Presets: "CPU", "GPU", "GPU-NVIDIA", "NVME", "HDD", "SSD"
#     * "GPU-NVIDIA" uses nvidia-smi for NVIDIA GPUs (most reliable for NVIDIA)
#     * "GPU" uses lm_sensors (works for AMD GPUs)
#   - Explicit: "adapter:field" or "adapter.field" (e.g., "k10temp-pci-00c3:Tctl")
#   - Use 'sensors' command to see lm_sensors, or 'nvidia-smi' for NVIDIA GPUs
# - transition_frames: Smoothness of color transitions between zones
#   - 0 = instant switch
#   - 30 = 1 second fade (at 30 FPS)
#   - 60 = 2 second fade
# - zones: Array of temperature ranges with effects
#   - Must be contiguous (zone1.max_temp == zone2.min_temp)
#   - If temp is outside all zones, clamps to nearest zone
#   - Each zone supports all normal effect types and options
# - Fallback behavior: If sensor read fails, LEDs blink magenta then turn off
